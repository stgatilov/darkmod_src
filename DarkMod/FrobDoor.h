 * CFrobDoor is a replacement for idDoor. The reason for this replacement is
 * because idDoor is derived from idMover_binary and can only slide from one
 * position into another. In order to make swinging doors we need to rotate
 * them but this doesn't work with normal idDoors. So CFrobDoor is a mixture
 * of idDoor and idMover.

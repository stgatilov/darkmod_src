 * Revision 1.17  2005/10/16 02:18:31  ishtvan
 * *) completed rope orbiting
 *
 * *) added failsafe for rope arrow attachment
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2005/10/14 09:04:19  ishtvan
 * updated rope climbing
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2005/10/12 14:52:52  domarius
 * Rope arrow - initial stage, just sticks you to the rope point of origin... permanently.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2005/09/17 07:15:28  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added function that applies damage to the player when mantling at a high relative velocity. The damage amount is computed from minimum and scale constants in DarkModGlobals.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2005/09/14 04:21:07  domarius
 * no message
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2005/09/09 19:56:02  ishtvan
 * removed water jump, allowed mantling out of water
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2005/09/08 04:42:34  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added mantle and lean states to the save/restore methods.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2005/09/04 20:38:20  sophisticatedzombie
 * The collision/render model leaning of the player model is now accomplished by rotation of the waist joint of the model skeleton.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/08/19 00:28:02  lloyd
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2005/08/14 23:29:04  sophisticatedzombie
 * Broke methods into smaller more logical units.
 * Changed header documentation to use doxygen format and doxygen tags.
 * Leaning and Mantling constants moved to DarkModGlobals
 * Fixed infinite loop that could occur in mantling test due to floating point number precision.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2005/08/04 05:16:43  sophisticatedzombie
 * Lean angle is now 12 degrees rather than 20.
 * Leaning now uses sinusoidal velocity rather than linear velocity.
 * Its still to bumpy, but pushing the player up is the only way to keep them out of the floor that I have come up with yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/08/01 22:37:09  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added rotation test to the UpdateClipModelOrientation method which detects collisions due to changes in player yaw in between frames.  This can happen when leaning, leading to the clip model penetrating a nearby surface, thereby breaking collision "sidedness" calculations.  In order to get around the issue, if the rotation test detects that the change in player yaw between the last frame and this frame resulted in collision with another collision model, then the player snaps to the upright position.  It prevents the ability to rotate the view through objects.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/07/30 01:31:28  sophisticatedzombie
 * Somewhat improved collision detection. Work needs to be done on handling collisions due to viewpoint rotation while in a leaned position.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/07/27 20:48:09  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added leaning.  The clip model stuff still needs alot of work.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/07/03 18:37:02  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added a time variable which accumulates the milliseconds that the jump button is held down.  If it gets greater than a constant (JUMP_HOLD_MANTLE_TRIGGER_MILLISECONDS) then a mantle attempt is initiated.  The timer is not reset until jump is released, so you can hold it in while falling and try to catch something.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2005/07/01 21:21:23  sophisticatedzombie
 * This is my check in of the mantling code on July 1, 2005.  I've tested it agains the .3 sdk, but not the .2 one.  Any takers?
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2004/10/30 15:52:34  sparhawk
 * Initial release
